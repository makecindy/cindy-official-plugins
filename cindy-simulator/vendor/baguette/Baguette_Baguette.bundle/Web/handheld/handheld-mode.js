// HandheldMode — the stream held in the hand, the way a real phone is.
//
// On a desk the page is a workbench: toolbar, rails, the device drawn
// in its bezel. On a phone that same page is a phone inside a phone —
// the live screen ends up under half the glass. Handheld drops all of
// it and gives the simulator's screen the whole view, contain-fit,
// black around it.
//
// This class owns no DOM. It answers the three questions the page has
// to ask — should we be handheld, what address remembers it, how big
// is the screen — and sim-native.js does the painting. Same split as
// ToolbarFold: the arithmetic is unit-tested, the rendering is
// integration-only.
